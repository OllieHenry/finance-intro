# finance-intro
Exercises and notes from Capi≈Ñski & Zastawniak's *Numerical Methods in Finance with C++*.

I'm working through this book to learn about C++ and financial models. My code for exercises will live in this repo, possibly alongisde some notes.

I have no affiliation with the authors or with Cambridge University Press. The book is not my IP and no part of it will be reproduced here.
